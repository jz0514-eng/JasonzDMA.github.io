         <h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>
		Jason Zheng is a student at San José State University, majoring in Digital 
Media Art with a focus on UI/UX design. Growing up heavily influenced by
 video games and visual media, he became interested in how digital 
artwork can express emotions and messages that are not possible with 
words.

       <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
       </p> 
     The goal with my work is to capture or create what I like and what I find 
interesting. It could be a random idea I come up with, or a random view I
 came across. I enjoy taking pictures of what I find and use them later as 
reference photos or use them as inspiration, as long as they are 
interesting. Because if there wasn’t an interest in it, there wouldn’t be an 
artist who would want to make something about it, and because of this, 
the majority of my artwork is personal to me and often contains messages
 that only someone who knows me would understand.

      <br>
      <br>

         I also like experimenting with different media to find what works best, as 
people always say creativity is when you put something 
unexpected together, and I also found that by experimenting with 
different medium, it could give me a different point of view of the same 
topic, for example, photography, before I started doing photography, I 
rush to my destination, but after I started trying to take a picture and 
beware of what is around me, I started paying more attention to what is 
going on, and was able to see a lot more interesting things that I normally skipped.

       Being able to expand your perspective is an important skill, in my opinion.
 by trying out new things, you will be able to push your limits and create 
work that is unique and different, for example, it can be sewing, by using 
fabric and stitching your artwork, you will be able to create a unique 
texture, while it can be challenging as I’m experimenting with a new medium,
  but it is still important to try, because if you have never tried, you would be 
able to learn, and you will never know if it will work out, and I also believe 
that the process of creating is also important, because when you are 
making something, you are constantly learning and practicing, and 
sometimes the message of an artwork is within the process, while the 
results are only an artifact of what's left behind.

<br>
       <br>
       In my opinion, being an artist is not just about creating art, but also the 
journey of self-discovery. By creating artwork that feels personal, you are
 able to express your feelings and create artwork that represents the life 
of the artist. And that is my goal with what I create, something that 
reflects on my past and my dream. Freedom is also a core part of being an
 artist; the only thing limiting you is your imagination. Being an artist is the
 journey of trying new things and finding what is fun, and to find what 
best fits you and represents you the most, and to express those ideas 
with the artwork you create.
