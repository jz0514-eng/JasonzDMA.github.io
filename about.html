		Jason Zheng is a student at San José State University, majoring in Digital 
Media Art with a focus on UI/UX design. Growing up heavily influenced by
 video games and visual media, he became interested in how digital 
artwork can express emotions and messages that are not possible with 
words.
       <br>
       <br>
       </p> 
      With this idea in mind, he aims to connect his creative process to his 
hobbies. He tries to expand the range of media he could use in his 
creative process by experimenting with different media such as sewing, 
painting, and sculpting. This also made him study Digital Media Art, where
 he could experiment with more media to expand his scope and 
techniques.

           At San José State University, Jason has been experimenting with different
 media such as 3D modeling, video art, photography, and coding. Through
 this process, he discovered an interest in photography and UI/UX design.
 He finds a unique sense of accomplishment when creating a functional 
code in JavaScript or slowing down to see a different point of view with 
photography.
<br>
       <br>
       Jason's work often explores ways to connect different ideas. He is 
interested in how digital tools can create interactions between concepts 
that normally don't appear together. Whether it is coding or capturing a 
photograph, he aims to create work that feels personal while also 
engaging with modern digital technology.

<br>
       <br>
       Currently, he is exploring how UI/UX principles can change his creative 
process and how JavaScript can be used to bring more ideas to life.
